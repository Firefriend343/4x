Random System Generator - https://firefriend343.github.io/4x/generator.html

The system generator is the most developed page so far. It's meant to simulate one random system that will be used in the finished game.
In the generator, the number, position, and image of planets are determined. Some of the planets are fit for colonization, and some can be used for mining. 
There is also a star in the general center. If you hover over it you can "designate" this system to be of a certain type, and it will gather currency corresponding to that type.
If you hover your mouse over any planet, a menu will show up referring to the properties of that specific planet. Surveying a planet also shows most of its random statistics. 
In the final game, you are meant to play as some alien species. When you begin playing, you can pick your preferred planet (in the bottom left corner). You can colonize any habitable planet, even the ones you did not select as your preferred choice, and they have a population statistic shown in their survey.
The population is capped out at double the random size statistic. The size also corresponds to the size of the planet's game sprite.
The blue icon next to the star represents a starbase, where you can build military vessels. This will be utilized more when I make the game multiplayer, but right now they're just a source of points.
At the top, there is a bar across the screen, the "HUD", where you can view your currency. The currencies are in order: Minerals, Credits, Authority, and Supplies.
Minerals are used for building structures, ships, and colonies. Credits are a generic "money" currency that is used for mostly everything. Authority represents how much control you have over your empire's population, and the extent of what you can do. It costs Authority to build colonies and large ships. The last currency, Supplies, is used in building colonies for your empire. You can gain Minerals and Credits from salvaging a Junk Planet, and Supplies from salvaging a Gas Giant (clicking on them).
Your colonies and mining stations(which are built on mining-suitable planets) require credits in upkeep, but Mining Stations produce Minerals, and colonies produce Credits and Authority(the amount is determined by the size of the colony).
There are also randomly occuring "events", which occur when certain conditions are met and a random number is triggered. So far, all of these execute when you pass to your next turn. There are five so far.

Thats all I have for now, but I want to add more Events and also some kind of tech tree. I drew all of the sprites myself as well.
